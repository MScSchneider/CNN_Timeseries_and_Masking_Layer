# Introduction
This repo contains the experiment code belongs to the paper "An end-to-end machine learning approach with explanation for time series with varying lengths".

It shows some code snippets for python, to use cnn with masking layer for timeseries with varying length and use CAM for visualisation of the activation result of the Gloabel Average Pooling (GAP) layer.

# Requirements
- python                        3.8.10
- pandas                        1.3.3
- numpy                         1.23.5
- matplotlib                    3.4.3
- keras                         2.6.0
- tensorflow                    2.6.0+nv
